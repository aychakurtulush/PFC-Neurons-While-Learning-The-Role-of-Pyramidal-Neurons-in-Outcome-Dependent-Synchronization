PFC Neurons While Learning: The Role of Pyramidal Neurons in Outcome-Dependent Synchronization is a research project that aims to study the role of pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during outcome-dependent synchronization. The project is hosted on GitHub and is a collaboration between researchers in the fields of neuroscience and machine learning.

The project uses a combination of computational models and experimental data to study the behavior of pyramidal neurons in PFC during learning and decision-making tasks. The researchers develop and analyze models that simulate the behavior of pyramidal neurons in the PFC, with a focus on how these neurons synchronize their activity in response to different outcomes.

The project is built using Python and a variety of machine learning tools, including TensorFlow and Keras. The code is well-documented and includes a number of simulations and visualizations that help to illustrate the behavior of the pyramidal neurons and the outcomes of the learning tasks.

One of the key features of PFC Neurons While Learning is its interdisciplinary approach, which brings together experts from different fields to explore the complex interactions between pyramidal neurons and learning outcomes. By combining computational models and experimental data, the researchers are able to gain new insights into the mechanisms that underlie learning and decision-making in the brain.

### Overall, PFC Neurons While Learning is a cutting-edge research project that explores the fascinating and complex world of pyramidal neurons in PFC. With its interdisciplinary approach and use of machine learning tools, the project is a valuable resource for researchers and students who are interested in neuroscience, machine learning, and the intersection of the two fields.
